We are seeking a Backend Engineer to join our growing fintech platform team. The ideal candidate will have at least 3 years of experience working with scalable backend systems using Java and Spring Boot.

Responsibilities include designing microservices architectures, integrating with RESTful APIs, and deploying applications using Docker and AWS services such as Lambda, EC2, and S3.

You should be comfortable working in CI/CD environments and have hands-on experience with infrastructure as code (Terraform preferred). Familiarity with Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, and monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana is a plus.

We work in a fast-paced Agile environment, so good collaboration skills and familiarity with tools like JIRA, GitHub, and Confluence is expected.
